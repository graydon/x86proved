    Specification logic -- step-indexed and with hidden frames

    This is a step-indexed version of the specification logic defined in Chapter
    3 of Krishnaswami's thesis, which is adapted from Birkedal et al.
    A specification S is a predicate on nat and SPred, where it holds for a pair
    (k,P) if it denotes a "desirable" machine execution for up to k steps
    starting from any machine configuration that has a sub-state satisfying P.
    The meaning of "desirable" depends on S; it might, for example, mean "safe
    under certain assumptions". Note the wording "up to" and "sub-state" above:
    they suggest that formally, S must be closed under decreasing k and starring
    on assertions to P.

    The utility of this is to get a higher-order frame rule in the specification
    logic, which is very valuable for a low-level language that does not have
    structured control flow and therefore does not have the structure required
    to define a Hoare triple. When frames cannot be fixed by the symmetry of
    pre- and postconditions, they must float freely around the specification
    logic, which is exactly what the higher-order frame rule allows -- see
    [spec_frame].
